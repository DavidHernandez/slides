Hi there. Today I'm going to speak about maintenance, and more precisely, about how to write maintainable code. But, before I begin, let me introduce myself.

Some people thinks that the maintenance starts with the second line of code you write. Even if you work alone and you don't take care, after a couple months, your old code will look like it was wrote by a complete stranger. We spend a lot of our time working on old code or working with code wrote by others. So...

As you can see in the pic, in this card we have sme names that describe some data. Even if we understand it, in a more complex document, it can cause issues of duplication or missunderstanding with other terms.

This issue is easily fixable using more clear names that avoid the confussion. Sometimes, they will be larger, but we will gain a text more easy to read and understand.

The same is applied to the code: functions, variables, classes... Everything uses a name. Make an effort to use better names and you will get almost the half of the job done.

Single Responsibility Principle.

Wikipedia defines a function as "a part of source code within a larger computer program that performs a specific task and is relatively independent of the remaining code". A function should do one and only one thing. An object should have have an objective.

If a function does two actions, it can be improved, splitting the function into two different functions.

A condition is an action: it takes a decission. If there is a condition and something else, extract the other part to a different function. A line that is repeated several times in the code, is a good candidate to become a new function.

Don't repeat yourself!

Try to avoid duplication in your code. If you have two lines of code that repeat themselves in different functions, try to extract it to a function.

  - Keep it simple!

  - A function that is too long is probably doing more than one thing. A function with more than 20 lines of code is a signal of that your code is doing multiple actions and can be simplified.

  - A function with complex code, usually can be splitted into different function, making it easier to read.

If there is a comment above the function, probably the name or the function can be improved.

Other problem that usually comes with the comments is, that the code evolve but the comments don't. When we are fixing something in the code, we fix the code without changing the comment. At the end, we have a comment that doesn't go with the code anymore.

Also happens that we use comments to remove temporarily part of the code. Don't do it. We have version control for that. The chances that you leave that code commented there are high and someday, someone will find that code and will not be sure of leaving it there or removing it.

I've seen code with more commented code than actual working code.

Even if the comments can be useful sometimes, normally, when we see a comment, it means that something...

Fortunately, Drupal has his own standard that can help us with a great tool for ensuring that we are following: Coder is an impressive tool.

For the rest, I suggest you to use the standards of each technology. When the standard is not clear, discuss it with your team and try to obtain an agreement with them. If that fails, you will have to take a decission.

Is better to take a decission on time than waiting eternally until a discussion ends.

Refactor! Get used to re-write your own code. The code of a different developer of your team, rewrite a patch from the issue queue. If you think something can be improve it, spend sometime in writing it in a better way.

If you work with an issue system, spend one-fifth of the time you have used on the issue on refactoring your code. If you use pomodoros to write code, put some refactoring pomodoros in the middle.

Testing is important. It help us keep the code stable and check that we haven't break anything when we do a change. But not only that, well designed tests can help to make the code easier.

If you want to find how something is done in your code, you run the test for it. Then, you can follow the code of the test to the part of the code that is actually doing it.

Doing some testing techniques as TDD or BDD help to make a better design of our code from the begining, also doing a bigger and better web of tests to cover our code.

If you are interested in this, tomorrow there is a workshop about TDD and BDD with Symfony 2. Check the website!
